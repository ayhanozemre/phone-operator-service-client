# - Phone Operator Service Client
A service client that you will use to send requests to the API of a private gsm operator.
I can't share the domain name because I don't have the right to use it, but you can find it if you click the door long enough.

## Setup

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- You must define the OPERATOR_DOMAIN variable in your environment
- ...and use within the project

## Disclaimer

- I am not responsible for anything done with this client.
